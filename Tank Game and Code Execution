  THE TANK GAME

This project is a major game project, as the prime requirement here, is to synchronize all the tasks of a game with LPC1769 
and Arduino uno and creating a game engine which can control the all the actions and movements of tank and enemy so that 
we can control every graphics.

From the very beginning, it was evident to us, that the conventional Infinite loop approach wonâ€™t be as efficient, as the 
code length would be enormous since we would have to write the code for the scheduler ourselves.

  GAME DESIGN:

The game consists of three horizontally moving sprites, which serve as the targets for the player. At the side of the screen, 
we have the tank, which the user can control. The tank is used to fire bullets at the target by pressing assign button. 
The up/down motion of the tank is controlled by the directional arrow keys using controller...
